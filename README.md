# bnsbot

**This project is most likely out-of-date due changed BnS addresses.**

**This project is not being maintained.**

My personal bot for Blade and Soul running Mushin's Tower 9F-15F (or 13F-15F, if corresponding 13F ticket exists in the upper-left inventory slot).

It was originally not planned to publicize this project. Parts in code are messy, unfinished, undocumented, or buggy.

## Requirements

* It is assumed that the character is a Wind Blade Dancer with the default keybindings.
* A Blade and Soul Anti-Cheat (XignCode) Bypass.
* Some .dll injector

## Usage

* In the BnS settings, change to classic combat mode.
* Inject the compiled *.dll file.
* Press
  * INSERT to start the bot.
  * DELETE to suspend the running bot.
  * END to close the bot.
